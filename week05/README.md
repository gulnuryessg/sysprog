# CH06/CH07/08/09... Multi-CPU

## Limited Direct Execution => mechanism
* baby proofing

## CPU scheduling => policy

### Algorithms/Policies

* FCFS, FIFO 
   + simplest
   - convoy effect

* Shortest Job First = nonpreemptive, SRTF = preemptive
   + optimal
   - you cannot predict future

* Priority Scheduling

* Round Robin, time quantum=10ms
   + fair
   - how much time is quantum?


* Multi Level Feedback Queue
* Lottery Scheduling
* Backery

### Metrics

* turnaround around time/completion time
* waiting time

* response time....
